Bowl Game Simulation
----------------

A simulation of a bowl game that managed to keep me busy for two weeks. Finally my mathematical prediction are partly proved and partly disproved.

The game goes like this:

When a group of friends finish their meal, each has a empty bowl. Nobody wants to wash the dishes and so the friends decide that they will play a dice game. Each participant bets his own bowl, or bowls and plays dice against another friend. Always the smallest number of bowls is bet in each match. The looser takes the bowls in game. The game is played until one of the friends is left with all the bowls and has to wash them.

For instance: Player A has 4 bowls and player B has 1. Player A wins. Now player A has 3 bowls and player B has 2. If player A wins again, player A is left with 1 bowl and player B with 4. This is because 2 bowls were in game. However if player B would won the last game, player A would be left with 5 bowls and player B would get out of the game with 0 bowls.

The question is: "Is the game a fair game and if not what is the optimal time to join to maximize the chance of wining? (not getting all the bowls)"

Run this simulation and see for yourself:
